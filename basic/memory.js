// in prior languages memory allocations and deallocations should have been done by programmer himself, but thanks to moren languages , automatic allo and deallo are done, automatic garbage collections are done.

//in js there are two types of memory 
//stack and heap.
//stack in primitive datatypes(call by value,gets copy of the variable changes made wont affect the original copy o the variable)
//head in non primitive datatypes(call by reference ,gets reference i.e actual location of reference and make changes to original copy of variable)
