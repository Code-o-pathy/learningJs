#js and classes
js is prototype based language, it technically doesnot have classes but syntactic sugar over existing prototype based mechanism. 
This helps developers coming from other class based languages

//objects are collection of properties and methods.




//why use OOP
code usuaally gets messy so to avoid this and spaghettification of code(non usability) OOP are used.
also get other features of class based languages like services function of java



//parts of loop

-object literal 

//literally creating a object


-constructor function
new keyword gives u a new instance for existing
function user(username){
    this.username=username;
    return this //this will return something else it will give undefined if not declared.
}
const one=user("hitesh) //hitest
const two=user('ankit')//ankit
console.log(one) //ankit
this happened because there was only one instance of 'user' and when we used another variable it changed the first and only instance, thats why use 'new'



-prototype


-instances(new , this)



4 pillars
-abstraction
-encapsulation
-inheritance
-polymorphism
